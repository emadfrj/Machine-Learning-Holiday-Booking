# Machine-Learning-Holiday-Booking
This code employs machine learning to classify the flight booking dataset associated with British Airways. The goal is to develop a model that predicts whether a customer will book a holiday with British Airways. First, Random Forest is used for calculating feature importance scores. Then variables with less impact on booking is removed from dataset. Finally, both random forest and neural network is used for prediction and the accuracy of them is compared.
